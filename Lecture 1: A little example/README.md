1. Description

This folder is a template for a course's lecture. Please, feel free to change whatever you think it could be better and notify it to the email list, <mailto:data-science-seville@googlegroups.com>.

### 1.1. Lecture structure

#### 1.1.1. Description of the lecture

This file, the `README.md`, will contains the description of the content. Something almost exactly the main `REAMDE.md` file of the course / repository.

A few things can differ, for example the content of the `Software` and the `Bibliography` lists, that will have only the information for this lecture, not for the entire course.

#### 1.1.2. The real content of the lecture

Use a combination of the next elements for your lecture. You don't need to have them all, or even you would like to use new ones. *It's your lecture!*

* Slides: Using the `slides.md` file you can write your slides using [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)'s `Markdown`syntax. Also, if we all use a similar writing style, like the one in the `slides.md` file, the slides will look like only one person write them, because of the use of a common [slide viewer](https://github.com/DataScienceSeville/slide-viewer). **THE SLIDES TOPIC IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.**

* Notes: If you need to create content like in a regular document format, use this `Markdown` file, the `notes.md` one.

* Images: If any of your `Markdown` files of this lecture folder need a image use the `images` directory.

* Problems and examples: These are two tricky folders. If you need to create `problems` and / or `examples` in your lecture, reference them in your slides, notes or in this description file.

  By that way, the folder should only conent `source code` files (`.r`, `.py`, `.ypnb`, etc.) with proper names. Use comments for the wordings, a big one at the beginning, and for other helps.

  If your problem or example is too complex and you need to create many files only for one of them, put them inside a folder, in the `problems` or `examples` directory, and use a proper name for distinct the main file.

* Data: Store in this folder the `data` you need for your problems and / or examples.

2. Software
-----------

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

3. Biblography
--------------

* Stanton, Jeffrey M. "Introduction to data science." (2013).
